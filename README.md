## 2024 Update

Since I originally started working on this 100% FREE course, a lot has happened:

- Has been viewed 2M+ times on FreeCodeCamp
- I started a new site called [Full Stack Foundations](https://www.fullstackfoundations.com) to consolidate course materials

I have renamed this course to "Frontend Web Development for Beginners" and will be continuing the "Full Stack" journey on the Full Stack Foundations site!

For all course updates and up-to-date information about it, please visit the course home page here:
