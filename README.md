## 2024 Update

Since I originally started working on this 100% FREE course, a lot has happened:

- Has been viewed 2M+ times on FreeCodeCamp
- I started a new site called [Full Stack Foundations](https://www.fullstackfoundations.com) to consolidate course materials
- I've learned a TON about web dev that I want to continue to share with you

In short, I underestimated how much work would be required to build a true "full stack" curriculum and thanks to a very busy day job, decided to stop the series after completing the "frontend" portion of it.  Because of this, I have renamed this course to "Frontend Web Development for Beginners".

But that's not where this ends.  I still intend to complete the "Full Stack Roadmap" and will be using the new Full Stack Foundations website to do this!  The materials of this course are still highly relevant in 2024 and provide a solid "foundation" for new web developers.
